# Shopify 3-Statement Model & DCF  

This project is a practice **3-statement financial model and discounted cash flow valuation** of Shopify Inc.  
I used Shopifyâ€™s 2022â€“2024 annual reports to build historicals and then projected 2025â€“2029 to estimate free cash flows and intrinsic equity value per share.

## What I Did
- Pulled revenue, expenses, and cash flow data from Shopifyâ€™s annual filings.  
- Projected revenue growth, margins, CapEx, and working capital based on historical averages.  
- Built a simple DCF with a 10% discount rate and 3% terminal growth.  
- Compared implied equity value to current share price.

## What I Learned
- How to connect Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow in a model.  
- How assumptions (growth, margins, WACC) affect valuation.  
- The importance of simplifying â€” not every line item is needed for a first model.
